                        <p>Founded by Innovation First International, VEX Robotics offers accessible, scalable robotics solutions for education. The program spans elementary to university levels, providing platforms tailored to various age groups and skill levels. In 2018, it was recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's largest robotics competition.</p>
                        <p>VEX Robotics competitions challenge students to design, build, and program robots for specific tasks within game-based engineering challenges. Divided into leagues like VEX IQ and VEX V5, these competitions promote critical thinking and innovation. Tournaments occur year-round, culminating in the VEX Robotics World Championship.</p>

                        <p>In the 2025–2026 VEX V5 Robotics Competition game, "Push Back," alliances of two teams each compete on a 12’ x 12’ field. The match consists of a 15-second Autonomous Period followed by a 1 minute and 45-second Driver Controlled Period. Teams aim to outscore opponents by placing Blocks into Goals and controlling zones.</p>
                        <p>A video reveal of the game typically demonstrates the rules, scoring, and field elements to help teams strategize for the new season. This visual guide is crucial for understanding the engineering challenges ahead.</p>
