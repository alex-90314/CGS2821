        <h1>VEX Robotics Competitions: Shaping the Engineers of Tomorrow</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>VEX Robotics Competitions History & Impact</h2>
            <p>Founded by Innovation First International, VEX Robotics offers accessible, scalable robotics solutions for education. The program spans elementary to university levels, providing platforms tailored to various age groups and skill levels. In 2018, it was recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's largest robotics competition</p>
            <p>VEX Robotics competitions challenge students to design, build, and program robots for specific tasks within game-based engineering challenges. Divided into leagues like VEX IQ and VEX V5, these competitions promote critical thinking and innovation. Tournaments occur year-round, culminating in the VEX Robotics World Championship.            </p>
            <p>Participation in VEX Robotics competitions enhances students' interest and proficiency in STEM subjects. According to VEX Robotics, 95% of participants report increased interest in STEM areas and a greater inclination toward pursuing STEM-related careers. These competitions also foster teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills.</p>
            <p>VEX Robotics has achieved international acclaim, engaging students from over 50 countries in its competitions. The annual VEX Robotics World Championship attracts thousands of participants worldwide, fostering cross-cultural collaboration and innovation. This global platform not only enhances technical skills but also promotes diversity and inclusivity in STEM education.</p>
            <blockquote>"The VEX Robotics Competition... continues to inspire, motivate and prepare kids for a future in advanced STEM education and related professions." — Jason Morrella, President of the REC Foundation</blockquote>

            <h2>This Years Game</h2>
            <p>In the 2025–2026 VEX V5 Robotics Competition game, "Push Back," alliances of two teams each compete on a 12’ x 12’ field. The match consists of a 15-second Autonomous Period followed by a 1 minute and 45-second Driver Controlled Period. Teams aim to outscore opponents by placing Blocks into Goals, controlling zones within those Goals, and parking robots in designated zones at the match's end. The field features 88 Blocks, four Goals (two Long and two Center), and two Park Zones. Each Block scored in a Goal earns three points, with additional points awarded for controlling zones and parking. The alliance with the highest Autonomous Period score receives a 10-point bonus. </p>
            <p>"Push Back" challenges teams to develop robots capable of efficient Block manipulation, precise movement, and strategic planning. The game's design encourages innovation in robot mechanisms and programming to maximize scoring opportunities. By emphasizing both autonomous and driver-controlled skills, "Push Back" fosters a comprehensive understanding of robotics principles, preparing students for real-world STEM applications.</p>
